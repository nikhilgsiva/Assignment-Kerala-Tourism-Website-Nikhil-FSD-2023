            Thrissur
                </h1>
<p> Trichur, also known by its historical name Thrissivaperur, is a city and the headquarters of the Thrissur district in Kerala, India. It is the third largest urban agglomeration in Kerala after Kochi and Kozhikode, and the 21st largest in India. The city is built around a 65-acre (26 ha) hillock called the Thekkinkaadu Maidaanam which seats a large Hindu Shiva Temple. It is located central of the state, and 304 kilometres (189 mi) north-west of the state's capital city, Thiruvananthapuram. Thrissur was once the capital of the Kingdom of Cochin, and was a point of contact for the Assyrians, Greeks, Persians, Arabs, Romans, Portuguese, Dutch and English.

    Thrissur is also known as the Cultural Capital of Kerala because of its cultural, spiritual and religious leanings throughout history. The city centre contains the Kerala Sangeetha Nadaka Academy, Kerala Lalithakala Akademi and Kerala Sahitya Academy. The city hosts the Thrissur Pooram festival, the most colourful and spectacular temple festival in Kerala. The festival is held at the Thekkinkadu Maidan in April or May, in the Malayalam month 'medam'.
    
    Religion is important and varied in Thrissur. The city has historically been a centre of Hindu scholarship, and Christianity, Islam and Judaism are believed to have entered the Indian subcontinent through Thrissur and its surrounding areas. Thrissur has a large number of well-known temples including the Vadakkumnathan temple, Thiruvambadi Sri Krishna Temple, and Paramekkavu temple. There are three major Catholic churches, the St. Antony's Syro-Malabar Catholic Forane, Our Lady of Lourdes Syro-Malabar Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral

                        <h4> Vadakkumnathan Temple </h4>
                       <p> The renowned Vadakkumnathan temple is one of the oldest temples in Kerala.

Situated in a nine-acre walled patch of green, it received the ‘Award of Excellence’ at the UNESCO Asia-Pacific Awards for Cultural Heritage Conservation. This was in recognition of the efforts taken to protect its architectural legacy.
                        The temple houses stunning murals, intricately carved wooden sculptures and exquisite woodwork. It highlights the culture, heritage, architectural brilliance and the great history of God’s Own Country. The annual festival of this temple, ‘Thrissur Pooram’ is often referred to as the festival of festivals, because of its richness, vibrance, and magnitude. </p>
